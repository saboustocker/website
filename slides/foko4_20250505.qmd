# Aim and Research Questions

## Aim

:::{.v-center-container}

 Can we diagnose state-dependent mechanisms influencing decisions under risk and uncertainty by utilizing verbal protocols as data?
:::


:::{.notes}
- last time, I did ask you that I want to find out if we can use think-aloud protocols for diagnosing state-dependent mechanisms, this time I am telling you if I managed to do exactly that!

## Research Questions {.smaller}

:::{.v-center-container}
1. To what degree can natural language data from think-aloud protocols be used to reliably classify different classes of experimentally induced psychological mechanisms?
2. To what extent are the language markers associated with each psychological mechanism unique to their respective class (vs. co-occurring across multiple classes)?
3. If there are language markers that overlap across classes of mechanisms, to what extent can classes of decision mechanisms still be distinguished from each other?

:::{.notes}
[Footnote]: Deepseek R1 was only performed on no pre-processing due to time and budget reasons. One run of all classifications with Deepseek R1 took about 60-70 hours. Additionally, there is evidence that for Chat-Based Decoders, pre-processing is not as relevant as for embedding-generating algorithms (source, source, source), and may even benefit them by providing additional context.

# Discussion

## Implications of Results

- Utilizing verbal protocols as data *can* be used to diagnose state-specific mechanisms influencing decisions under risk and uncertainty! 
- Prompt-based strategies and embedding-based strategies (if done right) work equally well.
- Consider what population the data comes from.

## Limitations

- Sample size: ~75 per group
    - No additional fine-tuning in models - potential to work even better with fine-tuned weights
- Controllability of context by experimental setup


# Q & A

## Your questions?

## My questions

1. How can I assess the impact of credibly better specifications (effect size)? 
2. Researcher degrees of (reporting) freedom? 

. . .

:::{.smaller-p}
**And some administrative questions for Renato**

- Is it okay for me to have public repositories in relation to my Master's thesis on my personal GitHub (applet)?
- How should we submit the final Master's Thesis (PDF as E-Mail attachment, print, to whom, submission in official UZH tool by us or supervisor, ...)?
